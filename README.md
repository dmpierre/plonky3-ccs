A [plonky3]() to [CCS]() converter. 

## Notes


## Acknowledgements 

- Most of the code used for extracting polynomials out of plonky3 air circuits has been inspired (if not copied) from [ed255](https://github.com/ed255)'s plonky3 frontend for halo2. It is available [here](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/halo2/tree/main/p3_frontend). 
- [ed255](https://github.com/ed255) gave me very valuable advices on how to proceed, thanks to him!
